## Notes ⚠️
- More pictures and videos will be shared soon.
- The provided files are to be used at your own risk.
- The dimensional tolerances may vary between 3D printers. See acceptable tolerances under [`Production/Technical-Drawings`](/Production/Technical-Drawings).
- The complete units showed in pictures and videos shared in this repo were printed with [JLCPCB 3D printing service](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote), with material of 8000 Resin, and remarked to print at an 30/45 angle for better Z-axis accuracy.
- Do ensure to run the machine at a ventilated area or fan-cooled to prevent the motor from overheating.
